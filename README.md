django back track tutorials

This is just a stupid commit on using the Django frame work.
It follows the tutorials shown at the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/intro/" style="color: blue;">djangoproject</a>
website.
Feel free to try them out on your own.
They are really fun when learning Django.
